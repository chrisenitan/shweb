# Shweb

A browser extension for transporting local-storage

- [Extension on Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/shweb)

**Why**

- Often times, web applications use local storage to store settings, text field values and other website specifc assets, having them backed up and available to sue on any browser/device is a productivity hack.
- Did you know you can loose these if you logout or reset something on your browser like cache.
- Avoid that with Shweb. Shweb allows you back up those notes via browser `local-storage`
  - with an interface you can use to import and export those local storage content. And for all other safety reasons its worth:
    - website settings...

**Features**

1. export local storage from specific websites
2. import exported local storage from specific website (to one or more sites)

**Planned**

- automatic periodic export saves to google drive
  - mark website as subscribed and configure folder and naming structure to backup in shweb local-storage and or back up in google drive.
- Support other browser apart from Chrome
